/*
 * Challenge: Perfect Number Finder
 * 
 * Write a C program that performs the following tasks:
 * 
 * 1. Implement a function `int isPerfectNumber(int num)` that checks if a number `num` is a perfect number.
 *    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
 * 
 * 2. Implement a function `void displayPerfectNumbers(int limit)` that prints all perfect numbers up to the given `limit`.
 * 
 * 3. In the `main` function:
 *    - Prompt the user to enter an integer `limit`.
 *    - Call `displayPerfectNumbers(limit)` to show all perfect numbers up to that limit.
